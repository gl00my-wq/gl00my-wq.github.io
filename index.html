      <p class="subsection-title">Challenge Introduction:</p>
      <p>With the rise of live broadcasting services, users have a higher expectation of video quality. The great variations of videographic skills in shot environment, photographic apparatus, compression and processing protocols give rise to very complicated impairments in the live broadcasting videos, which can adversely impact the quality of experience (QoE) of end users.The complexity of distortion in live broadcasting videos and the fact that user experience is subjective and hard to quantify and measure pose challenges to QoE-based live video quality assessment (VQA).
        To address this challenge, we have built a large VQA database for live broadcasting with the associated QoE scores. It consists of 1013 videos with a carefully selected range of distortion type and intensity, focusing on the complicated impairments induced in the live broadcasting services. The paper can be found at <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802978" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
      <p>Our dataset fills the gap in publicly available datasets for studying the comprehensive effects of distortions in live video. We also conducted a subjective experiment, and with the analysis of the collected subjective data, it was found that the test results in the proposed database were not satisfactory, indicating that further work has to be done to deeply measure the characteristics of those specific distortions in live broadcasting videos. This proposed competition invites participants to benchmark their models on our publicly available database.</p>

      <p class="subsection-title"> Challenge Significance:</p>
      <p>The competition aims to foster innovation in both subjective and objective VQA techniques tailored to live broadcasting videos, addressing the unique challenges posed by live streaming impairments while emphasizing the evaluation of QoE. It also encourages the exploration of novel perceptual metrics that integrate QoE evaluation with learning-based approaches, extending beyond traditional distortion-focused methods.
      The competition is highly relevant to the fields of visual communication and video processing, as it supports the development of practical algorithms that can be applied in real-world scenarios such as live video streaming, content recommendation, mobile video capturing, and video enhancement. By advancing the state-of-the-art in live video quality assessment, this challenge will contribute to optimizing the visual quality and Quality of Experience (QoE) for live streaming platform users.</p>

      <p class="subsection-title">Evaluation:</p>
      <p>The evaluation consists of the comparison of the predictions with the reference ground truth, Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). We will assess your solutions based on Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman’s Rank-order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC).
        </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC)</h2>
      <p>Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) is a measure of the linear correlation between the subjective scores and the mapped scores, which means the prediction accuracy:</p>
      <div class="formula">
        <p>\( PLCC = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (s_i - \bar{s})(f_i - \bar{f})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (s_i - \bar{s})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} (f_i - \bar{f})^2}} \)</p>
      </div>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>\( s_i \)</b> and <b>\( \bar{s} \)</b> are the \(i\)-th subjective score and the mean of all \(s_i\)</li>
        <li><b>\( f_i \)</b> and <b>\( \bar{f} \)</b> are the \(i\)-th mapped objective score after the non-linear mapping and the mean of all \(f_i\).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Spearman’s Rank-order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC)</h2>
      <p>Spearman’s Rank-order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) computes the prediction monotonicity and indicates how well the relationship between subjective and objective quality can be depicted by a monotonic function:</p>
      <div class="formula">
        <p>\( SRCC = 1 - \frac{6 \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i^2}{N(N^2 - 1)} \)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>\( N \)</b> represents the size of the testing dataset.</li>
